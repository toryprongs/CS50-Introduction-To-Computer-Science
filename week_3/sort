sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: took less time for sorted data than for random, as bubble sort stops early if no swaps are needed.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: the fastest time between all sorts, both for sorted and random data (O(n log n) time)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it took almost the same time both for sorted and random data (always scans the whole array)
