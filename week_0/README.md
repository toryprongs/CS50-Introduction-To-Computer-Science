# Week 0 – Scratch

This week introduces the fundamentals of computer science using Scratch.

## What I learned
- basic programming concepts
- algorithms and sequencing
- loops and conditionals
- events and simple logic
- breaking a problem into smaller steps

## Project
The Scratch project demonstrates the use of basic control structures and logic
to create an interactive program.

## Tools
- Scratch (visual programming language)

## Notes
Week 0 focuses on building computational thinking skills before moving on
to text-based programming languages.
